# Finding New Prospects for Your Non-Profit

#### Every non-profit organization needs a constant stream of new donor prospects. The goal of this project is to increase the revenue of a non-profit organization by using Machine Learning Supervised Algorithms.

#### The analysis of the data was created based on the below criteria:

**A)The new prospect should match the oraganization's goals.**

**B)The new prospect must have the capacity to donate.**

**C)The new prospect should be reacheable.Â¶**

Currently the Non-Profit organization requires additional source of income in order to generate extra revenue and expand charity missions around the globe and also support and increase disaster recovery campaigns.
Machine Learning is been used in all types of business. Non-profit organizations are not stepping away from Machine Learning. Rather they are using it to increase the amount of donors by executing marketing campaigns constructed with Machine Learning algorithms. These campaigns are based on certain demographics such as particular interest, financial status and some others
